OVERVIEW:
---------

The tropical storm detection system consists of two programs:
1) tstorms
The input to this program is the netcdf model data. The program goes through the
data looking for points, in time and space, that satisfy the conditions for a tropical 
storm. The output from this program is a file called cyclones.
2) trajectory
This program takes the output from "tstorms" and sorts it out into trajectories.
It produces three files as output:
   ori   - has the origin points of the storms (lon, lat, date)
   traj  - has the complete storm trajectories  (lon, lat, max wind, min slp, date)
   stats - some statistic


COMPILATION:
------------

1) tstorms
Go to the source/tstorms directory. 
Edit the file path_names_for_modules. Change /usr/local/lib -lnetcdf to point
to the location of the netcdf library on your system. 
Change  /home/jjs/tstorms_wehner/source to the present directory.
Execute the command: compile_it tstorms_drive

2) trajectory
Go to the source/trajectory directory.
Edit the file path_names_for_modules. 
ts_tools.f90 has hardwired pathnames for the files imask_2 and landsea.map
in 4 places
    23:  landmask = '/home/jjs/tstorms_wehner/source/trajectory/landsea.map'
   137:  landmask = '/home/jjs/tstorms_wehner/source/trajectory/landsea.map'
   251:  landmask = '/home/jjs/tstorms_wehner/source/trajectory/landsea.map'
   376:  cmask = '/home/jjs/tstorms_wehner/source/trajectory/imask_2'
Change them.
Execute the command: compile_it trajectory


SCRIPTS:
--------

The directory scripts has some sample scripts for doing the analysis. Modify them as needed.
    run_tstorms      - runs the tropical storm detection programs tstorms and trajectory
    trajectory.csh   - runs trajectory by itself  (not usually needed but sometimes useful)
    fmaps_ori.csh    - plots ferret maps of tropical storm origin points
    fmaps_traj.csh   - plots ferret maps of tropical storm trajectories

I also have a bunch of graphics routines that use xmgrace, which you are welcome to use if you
have xmgrace installed on your system.


SAMPLE_OUTPUT:
--------------

The directory sample_output/e26 contains the output I got from analyzing the sample data you
sent me. You might want to try reproducing it to make sure everything is working ok.
